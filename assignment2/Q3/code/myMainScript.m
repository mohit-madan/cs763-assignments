flash

% Observation: Both results are as close as they can get and the joint
% entropy graphs are very similar. Only the flash graph has seemingly
% multiple low values around the tip

%
% Experiment
% 
% Within the bounds [-60:60] [-12:12] it finds always a good
% result. Even adding noise doesn't affect the accuracy too much. But when
% you go out of the searching range. E.g. 90 or 125 degrees, you get funny results.
% For 90 it stays at 90 and for 125 it has the minimum joint entropy when
% being upside down.
